0..1			AverageInterval
0..1			AverageTimePeriodAmount
0..1			AveragingMethod


Element:		AverageInterval
Description:	"The interval of time used for gas exchange measurement averages. Expressed in seconds."
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#s

Element:		AverageTimePeriodAmount
Description:	"The average time for the gas exchange measurement. Expressed in seconds."
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#s

Element:		AveragingMethod
Description:	"The methodology used for deriving gas measurement averages (e.g., rolling average, 10 second average)."
Value:			CodeableConcept from AveragingMethodVS


EntryElement:	CarbonDioxideOutput
Based on:		GasExchangeMeasurement
Description:	"The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) exhaled from the body into the atmosphere per unit time, expressed in milliliters or liters per minute (mL/min or L/min), standard temperature and pressure dry (STPD)."
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#L/min
SpecificType is LNC#19889-5

EntryElement:	MinuteVentilation
Based on:		GasExchangeMeasurement
Description:	"The volume of air exhaled from the body in one minute expressed in liters per minute. This is conventionally expressed at body temperature, saturated with water at atmospheric pressure body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS). The  total volume of breath exhaled per unit time, should include the volume of the volume of the breathing apparatus used in its measurement. Note, however, that when calculating the ventilatory equivalelnt for slopes involving ventilation, the VÌ‡E value should exclude the deadspace volume of the berathing apparatus."
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#L/min
SpecificType is LNC#75959-7

EntryElement:		OxygenConsumption
Based on:		GasExchangeMeasurement
Description:	"Rate of oxygen (O2) utilized in metabolic processes expressed in milliliters or liters per minute (mL/min or L/min)."
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#L/min	
SpecificType is LNC#60842-2		


EntryElement:	OxygenUptake
Based on:		GasExchangeMeasurement
Description:	"The amount of oxygen (O2) extracted from the inspired gas in each period, expressed in milliliters or liters per minute (mL/min or L/min), standard temperature and pressure dry (STPD)"
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#L/min
SpecificType is LNC#222222	

EntryElement:	RespiratoryRate
Based on:		GasExchangeMeasurement
Description:	"Number of breaths per minute"
Value:			Quantity with units UCUM#1/min
