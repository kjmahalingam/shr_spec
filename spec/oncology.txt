0..1			ColdIschemiaTime

		Element:	 	ColdIschemiaTime
		Description:	"The time between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced."

EntryElement:	BreastCancerPresenceStatement

Based on:		ConditionPresenceStatement  
Description:	"FindingTopic or diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The BreastCancerPresenceStatement is a subclass of ConditionPresenceStatement, which is a departure from CIMI. In CIMI, this would be a archetype of ClinicalStatement combining a BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext. This would require definition of BreastCancerConditionTopic in the reference model, follwed by introduction of constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior in the corresponding archetype."

The interpretation of positive or negative (found in the interpretation property) is based on the staining percentage, and may take into account the staining intensity. 

Based on discussion with Cancer Interoperability Group subject matter experts, there was insufficient rationale to include the following components in the data model: StainingControl, PrimaryAntibody, Allred Score (both total and component scores). We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

HER2 status (positive=present or overexpressed; negative=absent) is a factor in determining prognosis and treatment options.
