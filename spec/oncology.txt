		Element:	 	ColdIschemiaTime
		Description:	"The time between the chilling of a tissue or tissue sample and the time it is warmed. 
		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced."

Description:	"FindingTopic or diagnosis of cancer originating in the tissues of the breast, and potentially spread to other organs of the body.

The following steps are required to create this class in CIMI:

1) Update the CIMI Reference Model, adding the property MorphologyBehavior to create BreastCancerConditionTopic class.
2) Create an archetype of ClinicalStatement that combines the new topic BreastCancerConditionTopic with the ConditionPresenceContext, and introduces constraints on Value, Category, Stage, and MorphologyBehavior.

In this model, the path of least work was to subclass Condition, add the new attribute, and introduce the required constraints, all at once.

The attributes of ClinicalStatement are not included in this class because of the mapping difficulties discussed in Entry."

/*RMB: Prognostic stage is very similar to TNM (i.e., anatomic stage). Difference is the stage group is derived from
		ER, PR, HER2 and grade in addition to TNM. We should probably make TNM its own element.
		Option 1: making TNM its own data element, and refer to it from BreastCancerStage,
		where we would have an attribute to indicate whether the stage is prognostic or anatomic.
		
		Option 2 (less clumsly but also less reusable): make TNM its own data element, and define BreastCancerAnatomicStage
		and BreastCancerPrognosticStage as separate data elements, each referring to their key inputs:
			* BreastCancerAnatomicStage would refer to TNM only
			* BreastCancerPrognosticStage would refer to TNM, HER2 status, ER status, PR status and grade (nuclear or histologic,
			depending on the type of tumor).
		
		In both cases, the value would come from BreastCancerStageVS. Not sure what we would do with findingMethod, since
		for PrognosticStage the only viable option would be AJCC 8th edition (but that might change in the future).

This S-phase, short for synthesis phase, happens just before a cell divides into two new cells. ReferenceRange: Low <6, Intermediate 6-10, >10 High."

			Element:		Refseq
			Based on:		EvaluationComponent
			Concept:		TBD
			Description:	"The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcripts, and proteins. RefSeq sequences form a foundation for medical, functional, and diversity studies. They provide a stable reference for genome annotation, gene identification and characterization, mutation and polymorphism analysis (especially RefSeqGene records), expression studies, and comparative analyses."
