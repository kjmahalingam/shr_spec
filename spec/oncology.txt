		NOTE: In CIMI Version 0.0.4, processing of a specimen is represented as an independent clinical statement involving a SpecimenProcessingTopic and PerformanceContext. The CIMI clinical statement would be mapped to FHIR as a Procedure. In this case, the procedure involves chilling the specimen (the key or code) and the duration of that procedure (corresponding to PerformanceContext.duration) would be interpreted as the cold ischemic time. The drawback of this would be that the information on cold ischemic time (necessary for interpreting results) would not travel with the specimen. To provide a cutpoint between this IG and the rest of CIMI, and to avoid unnecessary complexity, an extension was introduced."

We are seeking feedback on whether or not those components should be included in this model.

			Description:	"The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) collection provides a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant, well-annotated set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcripts, and proteins. RefSeq sequences form a foundation for medical, functional, and diversity studies. They provide a stable reference for genome annotation, gene identification and characterization, mutation and polymorphism analysis (especially RefSeqGene records), expression studies, and comparative analyses."
